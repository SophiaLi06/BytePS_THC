This is the communication library for [BytePS](https://github.com/bytedance/byteps). It is designed for high performance RDMA. However, it also supports TCP.

## Build

```bash
git clone -b byteps https://github.com/bytedance/ps-lite
cd ps-lite 
make -j USE_RDMA=1
```

- Remove `USE_RDMA=1` if you don't want to build with RDMA ibverbs support.
- Add `USE_FABRIC=1` if you want to build with RDMA libfabric support for AWS Elastic Fabric Adaptor.

To build ps-lite with UCX:
```
# dependencies
sudo apt install -y build-essential libtool autoconf automake libnuma-dev unzip pkg-config

# build ucx
wget https://github.com/openucx/ucx/archive/refs/tags/v1.11.0.tar.gz
tar -xf v1.11.0.tar.gz
cd ucx-1.11.0
(./autogen.sh || ./autogen.sh) && ./configure --enable-logging --enable-mt --with-verbs --with-rdmacm --with-cuda=/usr/local/cuda
make clean && make -j && sudo make install -j

# build ps-lite
cd ..
make clean; USE_UCX=1 CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda USE_CUDA=1 make -j
```


## Concepts

In ps-lite, there are three roles: worker, server and scheduler. Each role is an independent process.

The scheduler is responsible for setting up the connections between workers and servers at initialization. There should be only 1 scheduler process.

A worker process only communicates with server processes, and vice versa. There won't be any traffic between worker-to-worker, and server-to-server.


## Tutorial

After build, you will have two testing applications under `tests/` dir, namely `test_benchmark` and `test_ipc_benchmark`. 
Below we elaborate how you can run with them. 

To debug, set `PS_VERBOSE=1` to see important logs during connection setup, and `PS_VERBOSE=2` to see each message log.

### 1. Basic benchmark

Suppose you want to run with 1 worker and 1 server on different machines. Therefore, we need to launch 3 processes in total (including the scheduler). You can launch the scheduler process at any machine as it does not affect the performance.

For the scheduler:

```
# common setup
export DMLC_ENABLE_RDMA=ibverbs
export DMLC_NUM_WORKER=1
export DMLC_NUM_SERVER=1 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI=10.0.0.2  # scheduler's RDMA interface IP 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_PORT=8123     # scheduler's port (can random choose)
export DMLC_INTERFACE=eth5        # my RDMA interface 

# launch scheduler
DMLC_ROLE=scheduler ./tests/test_benchmark
```


For the server:
```
# common setup
export DMLC_ENABLE_RDMA=ibverbs
export DMLC_NUM_WORKER=1
export DMLC_NUM_SERVER=1 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI=10.0.0.2  # scheduler's RDMA interface IP 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_PORT=8123     # scheduler's port (can random choose)
export DMLC_INTERFACE=eth5        # my RDMA interface 

# launch server
DMLC_ROLE=server ./tests/test_benchmark
```

For the worker:
```
# common setup
export DMLC_ENABLE_RDMA=ibverbs
export DMLC_NUM_WORKER=1
export DMLC_NUM_SERVER=1 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI=10.0.0.2  # scheduler's RDMA interface IP 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_PORT=8123     # scheduler's port (can random choose)
export DMLC_INTERFACE=eth5        # my RDMA interface 

# launch worker
DMLC_ROLE=worker ./tests/test_benchmark
```

If you want to use libfabric with Amazon Elastic Fabric Adaptor, make sure to set `DMLC_ENABLE_RDMA=fabric` for all processes. If you are
using libfabric < 1.10, please also set `FI_EFA_ENABLE_SHM_TRANSFER=0` to avoid a bug in the EFA shm provider.

If you just want to use TCP, make sure to unset `DMLC_ENABLE_RDMA` for all processes.

### 2. Benchmark with IPC support

The `test_ipc_benchmark` demonstrates how inter-process communication (IPC) helps improve RDMA performance when the server is co-located with the worker.

Suppose you have two machines. Each machine should launch a worker and a server process. 

For the scheduler: 
(you can launch it on either machine-0 or machine-1)
```
# common setup
export DMLC_ENABLE_RDMA=ibverbs
export DMLC_NUM_WORKER=2
export DMLC_NUM_SERVER=2 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI=10.0.0.2  # scheduler's RDMA interface IP 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_PORT=8123     # scheduler's port (can random choose)
export DMLC_INTERFACE=eth5        # my RDMA interface 

# launch scheduler
DMLC_ROLE=scheduler ./tests/test_ipc_benchmark
```

For machine-0 and machine-1:

```
# common setup
export DMLC_ENABLE_RDMA=ibverbs
export DMLC_NUM_WORKER=2
export DMLC_NUM_SERVER=2 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI=10.0.0.2  # scheduler's RDMA interface IP 
export DMLC_PS_ROOT_PORT=8123     # scheduler's port (can random choose)
export DMLC_INTERFACE=eth5        # my RDMA interface 

# launch server and worker
DMLC_ROLE=server ./tests/test_ipc_benchmark &
DMLC_ROLE=worker ./tests/test_ipc_benchmark 
```


Note: This benchmark is only valid for RDMA.
